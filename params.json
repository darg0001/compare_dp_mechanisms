The data used for demonstration are simulated genome-wide association study data generated by [HAP-SAMPLE](http://www.hapsample.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\nCode in this repository were used to produce results in the following paper:\r\n\r\n> \"Scalable privacy-preserving data sharing methodology for genome-wide association studies.\" Yu, F, S. Fienberg, S. SlavkoviÄ‡, C. Uhler (2014). Journal of Biomedical Informatics (forthcoming).  \r\n\r\nThe paper is available at [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008) and [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5193).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Example data generation #\r\n\r\nThe example case/control genotype data (`example/case_genotypes.dat` and `example/case_genotypes.dat`) were generated by [HAP-SAMPLE](http://www.hapsample.org/) with the following options:\r\n\r\n* Population: CEU\r\n* Source for SNPs: `Chrom9_Chrom13_snps.txt` \r\n* Disease Model File: `AR_chrom9_chrom13_Nov09_additive1_MAF025.txt`\r\n* Simulation Type: Case/Control\r\n* Number of Cases: 1000\r\n* Number of Controls: 1000\r\n* Average breaks per cM: 1\r\n* Output Format: SNPs v. Individuals\r\n\r\nThe disease model file describes a disease with 2 causative SNPs having addive effects. For more details about the disease model, see [Malaspinas & Uhler (2010)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4929).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Analysis on the example data #\r\nSee http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fy/compare_dp_mechanisms/blob/master/notebooks/compare_all_dp_mechanisms.ipynb\r\n\r\nOr if you have ipython notebook installed, run in the terminal\r\n\r\n    cd notebooks\r\n    ../start_ipynb.sh\r\n\r\nand open the `compare_all_dp_mechanisms` notebook in the browser. By default, the iPyhon notebook is at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to use the code #\r\nFirst of all, untar the example data:\r\n\r\n    tar xvfz exmaple.tar.gz\r\n\r\nThen convert raw data to genotype tables:\r\n\r\n    python ./notebooks/raw_to_geno_table.py ./example/case_genotypes.dat ./example/anticase_genotypes.dat ./table.tmp\r\n\r\nTo get results from the **Laplace mechanism**, run:\r\n\r\n    python ./notebooks/write_chisquare.py ./table.tmp ./chisquare.tmp\r\n    python ./notebooks/get_laplace_results.py k e n_case n_control ./chisquare.tmp\r\n\r\nwhere \"k\" is the number of top SNPs to release, \"e\" is the privacy budget (commonly known as epsilon in epsilon-differential privacy), and \"n_case\" and \"n_control\" are the numbers of cases and controls.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to get results from the **Exponential mechanism**, run:\r\n\r\n    python ./notebooks/write_chisquare.py ./table.tmp ./chisquare.tmp\r\n    python ./notebooks/get_expo_results.py k e n_case n_control ./chisquare.tmp\r\n\r\nTo get results from the **Johnson & Shmatikov method**, run:\r\n\r\n    python ./notebooks/write_JS_distance.py -p pval ./table.tmp ./js_distance.tmp\r\n    python ./notebooks/get_JS_results.py k e ./js_distance.tmp\r\n\r\nwhere \"pval\" is the p-value specified in [Johnson & Shmatikov (2013)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487687), which can be interpreted as the overall p-value (say 0.05) of the multiple testing problem involving thousands of SNPs.\r\n","google":"UA-63494301-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
